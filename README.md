This page contains links to a few of my programming projects. My [CodePen](https://codepen.io/emzarts/) also contains some smaller projects and creations. 

## Projects
* [Endangered Species](https://emzarts.github.io/endangered-species/index.html) 
  * Endangered Species is a website I made for my senior year web design class. It includes parallax images and a JavaScript sliding menu.
* [3D Printing](https://emzarts.github.io/3DPrinting/products.html)
  * This is a website designed for a fictional 3D printing company. It contains individual product pages that use JavaScript to display prices and to navigate through images. 
* [SONO Industries](https://emzarts.github.io/SONOindustries/)
  * SONO Industries is a small JavaScript game that is currently in progress. It is based on a story written by Rachel Boal. 
* [Clickbait](https://emzarts.github.io/PWAtest1/)
  * This is a fun and simple project I made to learn more about JavaScript. It is also a progressive web app. 
* [Sustainability in Wilton](https://emzarts.github.io/apes-passion-project/index.html)
  * Sustainability in Wilton was a website I designed for my AP Environmental Science class. It combines my passion for the environment and coding. 
* [HTML and CSS iPhone](https://codepen.io/emzarts/details/MbvJoe/)
  * This is a mockup iPhone made with HTML and CSS. When the home button is pressed the phone unlocks and displays images that can be scrolled through by clicking.

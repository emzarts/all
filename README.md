# Emily Zimmerman
This page contains links to a few of my programming projects. My [CodePen](https://codepen.io/emzarts/) also contains some smaller projects and creations. You can also view my resume [here](https://github.com/emzarts/all/blob/master/Emily%20M.%20Zimmerman%20Resume.pdf).

## Projects
* [Learn Hiragana](https://emzarts.github.io/learn-hiragana/index.html)

* [GRISPR-Cas9](https://emzarts.github.io/Zimmerman_Emily_20/)
  * Superbugs have become a threat to human health in recent years as bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics and drugs. This research project for Biology I explains this issue and the use of CRISPR-Cas9 as a potenital solution. 
* [Endangered Species](https://emzarts.github.io/endangered-species/index.html) 
  * Endangered Species is a website I made for my senior year web design class. It includes parallax images and a JavaScript sliding menu.
* [3D Printing](https://emzarts.github.io/3DPrinting/products.html)
  * This is a website designed for a fictional 3D printing company. It contains individual product pages that use JavaScript to display prices and to navigate through images. 
* [SONO Industries](https://emzarts.github.io/SONOindustries/)
  * SONO Industries is a small text-based JavaScript game that is currently in progress. It is based on a story written by Rachel Boal.

* [Sustainability in Wilton](https://emzarts.github.io/apes-passion-project/index.html)
  * Sustainability in Wilton was a website I designed for my AP Environmental Science class. It combines my passion for the environment and coding. 
* [TechNext RPI LEDs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-vWKUJD6QAMuONkKwSzJ5jCsCUrJ-tqTz5qiFDiZDok/edit?usp=sharing)
